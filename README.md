**Data and Interaction Flow:**

1. Raw data is ingested from various retail sources and streamed through Databricks on Azure, processed using Intel’s oneAPI for high-performance computing.
2. The transformed data is stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
3. LangChain manages the flow of queries to the LLMs, with RAG providing contextually relevant document retrieval from LLMIndex.
4. The OpenAI API and custom Hugging Face models (optimized with OpenVINO) generate insights and analytics.
5. Streamlit, running on Azure Static Web Apps, provides an interactive user interface for business users to engage with the analytics.
6. All system interactions are logged, and performance is monitored with Azure's monitoring tools, while security protocols are managed through Azure AD and Key Vault.
7. The entire system's development lifecycle, from code commits to deployment, is managed via GitHub and Azure DevOps, with Intel's tools ensuring optimized performance across all operations.

Creating user flow diagrams typically involves mapping out the step-by-step journey a user takes to complete a task within an application. Since I can't create visual diagrams directly in this format, I'll describe how you could structure a user flow diagram for RetailScanAI. You can then create the visual representation using diagramming tools such as Lucidchart, Microsoft Visio, or online tools like draw.io.
